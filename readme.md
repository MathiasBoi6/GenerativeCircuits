# Diffusian and NCA circuits

This is an initial readme file


This project depends upon [Evocraft](https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py), with the files 'minecraft_pb2.py' and 'minecraft_pb2_grpc.py' having been copied directly.

For code that communicates with Minecraft, open a server through the [Evocraft project](https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py).


Currently, this project contains multiple jupyter notebooks for testing and developing code.
